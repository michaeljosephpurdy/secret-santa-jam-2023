Usually it's 'Grandma Got Ran Over By a Reindeer', but this holiday season something crazy happened.
Somehow and old granny ran over this reindeer!  Now Santa isn't sure if he will recover for next Christmas, or if he should be sent off to the glue factory.

Use 'Q', 'W', 'E', and 'R' to get to the finish line to prove to Santa you still have it in you!

This is a game made for 'donnn' for Secret Santa Jam 2023.
'donnn' has been very good this year, and asked for a physics-based party game.

My intentions here was a QWOP-like.  It's not as fun as QWOP though, lol.
I was a bit strapped for time and couldn't completely finished.
Figured it was best to submit SOMETHING.
